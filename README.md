  <i align="center">Hey Lois, its the DemoMenu running properly in the decomp!</i>

# Overview
A Mania Decomp mod that overhauls the whole game to recreate the first Mania demos that were shown to the public (a.k.a. "Media Demo").<br>
If you never knew whats the Media Demo, here are a few honorable mentions:
* Demo contains 2 early stages, **Green Hill Zone 1** & **Studiopolis Zone 1**
* A fully functional menu on the title screen to select the 2 stages above
* The Cool Bonus is removed (oh yeah)
* And, a thanks for playing screen because why not...

# How to setup the Mod
You first need to symlink [GameAPI](https://github.com/Rubberduckycooly/GameAPI) then build ``MediaDemoRecreation.sln``.<br>
Once your build is successfully finished, copy or move the following in the ``build`` folder:<br>
* The entire ``Data`` folder
* The ``mod.ini``
* And most importantly, the ``MediaDemoRecreation.dll``.<br>

Then, make a new folder in your decomp's ``mods`` folder and paste it in there.<br>
Or, just download the release pre-built ones I guess. (Building is recommended, though)
