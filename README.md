# Sonic Mania: Media Demo Recreation
A Mania Decomp mod that overhauls the whole game to recreate the first Mania demos that were shown to the public (a.k.a. "Media Demo").<br>
If you never knew whats the Media Demo, here are a few honorable mentions:
* Demo contains 2 early stages, **Green Hill Zone 1** & **Studiopolis 1**.
* A fully functional menu to select the 2 stages above (which is actually still in the final version in Mania!)
* A pause menu that looks like nothing from the final
* The Cool Bonus is removed
* And, a thanks for playing screen because why not...
## Overview
As the name suggests, this mods aims to recreate most of the gameplay of the demo. That's really what i can say.
## How to Build
You first need to symlink [GameAPI](https://github.com/Rubberduckycooly/GameAPI) then build ``MediaDemoRecreation.sln``.<br>
Once your build is successfully finished, copy or move the ``Data`` folder and ``mod.ini`` in the ``build`` folder, then make a new folder in your decomp's ``mods`` folder and paste it in there.
